# Cash Reconciliation - How It Works

## Simple Explanation

### What is Reconciliation?

Closing your daily book by comparing what the system says you should have vs. what you actually have.

## Step-by-Step Process

### 1. System Shows You

- **Expected Total**: Money from today's sales only
- **Previous Balance**: What you had from last closing

### 2. You Count & Enter

Count everything you have RIGHT NOW at the store:

- **Cash**: Count all physical cash in drawer/safe
- **Mpesa Agent**: Check your agent account balance
- **Mpesa Phone**: Check your till number balance

**IMPORTANT**: Enter the TOTAL you have now, not just today's collection.

### 3. Special Cases

#### Deposits (Money In)

Use this ONLY if you brought extra money that's NOT from sales:

- ✅ Owner brought cash from home
- ✅ Withdrew money from bank
- ✅ Loan or external funds
- ❌ NOT for customer payments (those are already in sales)

#### Expenses (Money Out)

Use this ONLY if you paid something from the cash:

- ✅ Paid rent
- ✅ Bought supplies
- ✅ Paid utility bill
- ❌ NOT for business purchases for resale

### 4. Final Balance Calculation

**Your new closing balance** = What you counted + Deposits - Expenses

This becomes your "Previous Balance" for tomorrow.

## Example Scenario

### Yesterday's Close:

- Cash: 23,750
- Mpesa Agent: 14,233
- Mpesa Phone: 15,107
- **Total: 53,090**

### Today:

**Sales:** 1,580 (system recorded)

**At Closing Time, You Count:**

- Cash in drawer: 25,330 (23,750 + 1,580 from today)
- Mpesa Agent: 14,233 (no mpesa sales today)
- Mpesa Phone: 15,107 (no till sales today)

**Enter these amounts:**

- Actual Cash: 25,330
- Actual Mpesa Agent: 14,233
- Actual Mpesa Phone: 15,107

**If you had deposits (e.g., owner brought 17,800):**

- Enter Deposits: 17,800
- New Cash Balance = 25,330 + 17,800 = 43,130

**If you paid expenses (e.g., rent 500):**

- Enter Expenses: 500
- New Cash Balance = 25,330 + 17,800 - 500 = 42,630

## Common Mistakes

❌ **WRONG**: Entering only today's sales amount
✅ **CORRECT**: Entering total amount you have

❌ **WRONG**: Adding previous balance yourself
✅ **CORRECT**: System calculates everything automatically

❌ **WRONG**: Using deposits for customer payments
✅ **CORRECT**: Only for external money brought in

## Variance Explained

**Variance** = What you have - What system expected

- **Zero** (Green): Perfect! Everything matches
- **Positive** (Blue): You have MORE than expected (investigate)
- **Negative** (Red): You have LESS than expected (investigate)

## Tips for Accuracy

1. ✅ Count cash carefully at same time daily
2. ✅ Double-check Mpesa balances
3. ✅ Record deposits/expenses as they happen
4. ✅ Investigate any variance immediately
5. ✅ Keep physical cash separate from personal money
